# New HTML5 Features #

## Hands-on Lab ##

### Introduction ###

HTML5 is the emerging standard for building and writing HTML webpages for web sites and applications. HTML5 includes many new JavaScript APIs, providing features that could not previously be developed using JavaScript.

Support for HTML5 began in Internet Explorer 8 with features such as Web Storage. Under Internet Explorer 10, support for HTML5 was vastly expanded, with JavaScript APIs such as Web Sockets, Web Workers, and Application Cache.

This lab demonstrates the use of three major HTML5 JavaScript APIs that are supported in Internet Explorer 10: the **Drag-and-Drop API**, the **File API**, and the **Web Workers API**.

### Repository Structure ###

In the **root** folder of this repository you will find the Hands-On Lab (HOL) document, **HOL.md**. Before beginning with the HOL exercises, make sure you have followed all the required steps indicated at the setup section of the HOL document. 

In the **Source** folder you will find the source code of each of the exercises, as well as the assets and setup scripts. Throughout the HOL you will be instructed to open and explore the different solutions from the source folder. It is typically comprised of the following subfolders:

- **Assets:** This folder contains files that are used throughout the exercises.
- **_Exercise Name_:** Each exercise that requires a programming solution has its own code folder.
  - **Begin:** The begin solution is the initial incomplete solution that you will finish by following the steps of the corresponding exercise.
  - **End:** The end solution is the final result you will achieve at the end of an exercise.
- **Setup:** This folder contains the dependency files and the setup scripts necessary to initialize specific configurations of the lab, being its execution is required in the majority of the Hands-on Labs.

### Get Started ###

In order to run the solutions of the exercises provided by this lab you will first need configure your environment and install any necessary prerequisites such as runtimes, components, or libraries. Each lab includes setup instructions for getting started.
